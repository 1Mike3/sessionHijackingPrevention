# Session Hijacking Prevention

## About
This repository is created to examine methods for the prevention of session hijacking trough IP-Geolocation, and Browser fingerprinting, as a basis for my bachelor's thesis.

## General Info
### Security Info
+ This Programm logs many infos that should not be logged in a usual setting.
+ The saving of the cookies is done in the frontend in a way that makes it easier to exfiltrate (which is part of the goal of the project). To enchance Security they should be written from the backend and the appropriate flags should be set.
